# Regression Model: University Acceptance to Masters Programme

I just learnt how to make a regression model and predict future data using said model a few weeks ago, so I did this Learning-By-Building task to consolidate what I had learnt so far.
I used a dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions and it contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programmes.

The parameters included are :

- GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
- TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
- University Rating ( out of 5 )
- Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
- Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
- Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
- Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )

Dependencies:
- tidyverse
- lmtest
- MLmetrics
- GGally
- ggplot2
- car
